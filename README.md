# Whatsup Malaysia
Here I just collect my notes of where I would like to go in Malaysia
## Hiking
### Around Kuala Lumpur
1. [Forest Research Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/FRuUqgyMrMB6Apyk9)
2. [Bukit Tubur](https://goo.gl/maps/5cmP9LkMG48QnGXC6)
3. [Gunung Ledang (Mount Ophir)](https://goo.gl/maps/pAyKHu3gnrjTwqJc6)

### Borneo
1. [Bako Park](https://sarawakforestry.com/parks-and-reserves/bako-national-park/) \
It worths going there for at least 2 nights. First day I went to a short hike trail as I was tired after the trip. [Accomodation to stay](https://bakonationalpark.my/accommodation/). It looks like a camp next to a very nice national park. \
**How to reach:** \
a. Land to Sarawak town (buy airplane tickets in advance if you buy them a day before, you would pay x2, x3). \
b. Take a taxi ($15) or a bus to waterfront area of the town (it's next to the river and might be a downtown or something). You will need a Bako Bus Stop. \
c. Take a bus from Bako Bus Stop in Kuching. \
d. Take a boat ride ($25) to Bako. \

3. [Gunung Mulu National Park](https://mulupark.com/) \
This place is famous by its caves. There I can go to a cave trip and a forest boat ride. [Accomodation to stay](https://mulupark.com/accomodations-facilities/#discovery-centre). \
**How to reach:** Mulu can be reached by plane from Miri (30 minutes), Kuching (1 hour 20 minutes) & Kota Kinabalu (55 minutes). Miri, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu could be reached from KL for $40 - $70. [Here is more information of how to reach the place](https://mulupark.com/plan-your-trip/)
2. [Gunung Kinabalu](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/) (The highest mountain in Malaysia) \
Also looks very promising. It is a pretty serius hike. I think it is **at least** a 3 days trip. Dirst day I arrive to Kinabalu park and spend a night there to acclimatize. [Accomodation to stay](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/stay/kinabalu-park). \
I did not go there as it was $570 for 2 nights 3 days package. This was the only price I could find for this place. \
**How to reach:** Land to Kota Kinabalu airport (KL - Kota Kinabalu: 2:30 hrs, $70), [take a bus to Kinabula park](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/packages/mount-kinabalu-shuttle-transfers-kinabalu-park)
