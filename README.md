# Whatsup Malaysia
Here I just collect my notes of where I would like to go in Malaysia
## Hiking
### Around Kuala Lumpur
1. [Forest Research Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/FRuUqgyMrMB6Apyk9)
2. [Bukit Tubur](https://goo.gl/maps/5cmP9LkMG48QnGXC6)
3. [Gunung Ledang (Mount Ophir)](https://goo.gl/maps/pAyKHu3gnrjTwqJc6)

### Borneo
1. [Bako Park](https://sarawakforestry.com/parks-and-reserves/bako-national-park/) \
Looks very promising. It has accomodation to stay and people to explain what to do. So far it looks like a camp next to a very nice national park. My first priority place to go in Borneo island. \
**How to reach:** Land to Sarawak town (KL - Sarawak: 2 hrs, $50)
3. [Gunung Mulu National Park](https://mulupark.com/) \
This place is famous by its caves. There I can go to a cave trip and a forest boat ride. [Accomodation to stay](https://mulupark.com/accomodations-facilities/#discovery-centre). \
**How to reach:** Mulu can be reached by plane from Miri (30 minutes), Kuching (1 hour 20 minutes) & Kota Kinabalu (55 minutes). Miri, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu could be reached from KL for $40 - $70. [Here is more information of how to reach the place](https://mulupark.com/plan-your-trip/)
2. [Gunung Kinabalu](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/) (The highest mountain in Malaysia) \
Also looks very promising. It is a pretty serius hike. I think it is **at least** a 3 days trip. Dirst day I arrive to Kinabalu park and spend a night there to acclimatize. [Accomodation to stay](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/stay/kinabalu-park) \
**How to reach:** Land to Kota Kinabalu airport (KL - Kota Kinabalu: 2:30 hrs, $70), [take a bus to Kinabula park](https://www.mountkinabalu.com/packages/mount-kinabalu-shuttle-transfers-kinabalu-park)
